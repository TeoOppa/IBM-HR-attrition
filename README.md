# IBM-HR-attrition
Data Semantics, Data Exploration, Data preparation, etc

This is a simple program, written in python that I used for a first assessment of the data quality for the IBM HR Attrition dataset that you can find on Kaggle and other sites. The only purpose of this repository is to keep my file easily available for myself. This is part of a project for one of the courses at my university.
